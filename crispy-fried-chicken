How to Make Crispy Fried Chicken
There are as many "secret recipes" for fried chicken as there are cooks doing the frying. Some swear by soaking the chicken in buttermilk. Others create a brine for fried chicken or give it a dunk in beer batter, and a light coating of seasoned flour -- or a roll in crushed saltines.

The best way to discover your favorite method of homemade fried chicken is to experiment with different seasonings and techniques until you hit on your perfect preparation.

Batter Up:

This is how to get breading to stay on chicken.

Set up a "dredging station" to minimize mess and make cleanup easy. Put your ingredients and mixtures into large shallow bowls or baking dishes. Then work in one direction (left to right, for example), moving from seasoned flour to egg batter over to bread crumbs/panko/coating mixture. This dry-wet-dry method helps the ingredients stick to the chicken pieces.
Have one "wet hand" and one "dry hand" -- and use your "wet" hand to transfer chicken from the wet mixture to the coating bowl.
Place the coated chicken on the parchment- or wax paper-lined baking sheet.
Before easing the coated chicken pieces into hot fat, allow them to rest, which will give the coating a chance to adhere. Do this step in the refrigerator if you won't be frying the chicken within half an hour. (Allow the cold chicken to come to room temperature before frying or the oil temperature will drop and the chicken will cook unevenly and the coating won't get crispy.)
